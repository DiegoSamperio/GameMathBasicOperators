# Math Basic Operators Game

This project is a basic math game written in Python that challenges players to solve math operations across four levels: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Players need to answer quickly and accurately to avoid losing lives. 

## Features
- Four levels of math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Randomized numbers for each operation.
- Players start with 3 lives and must answer correctly to progress.
- A total of 20 math problems spread across the 4 levels.
- Final performance feedback based on the number of correct answers.

## How to Play
1. Run the Python script.
2. The game begins with addition problems. Enter the correct answers to continue.
3. Complete each level and advance to the next math operation.
4. Try to finish the game with as many correct answers and lives as possible.
